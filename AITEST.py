The 2010 Dietary Guidelines recommends eating  more unrefined carbohydrates and more fiber, and reducing  consumption of foods that are high in added sugars. To accomplish  these recommendations use some or all of the following  suggestions:  • Get more daily carbohydrate servings from whole grains by  eating a whole-grain cereal for breakfast, using whole-grain  bread to make a sandwich for lunch, and eating a serving of  beans and/or nuts with dinner.  • Make sure to get at least three servings (or more) of all the  grains you eat as whole grains every day. A serving of whole  grains is equal to one slice of whole-wheat bread, one ounce of  whole-grain cereal, and one-half cup of cooked cereal, brown  rice, or whole-wheat pasta.  Food products made with cornmeal use the whole grain so  choose tortillas, corn cereals, and corn breads with cornmeal  listed as the first ingredient.  • When baking, substitute whole-wheat flour or other whole- grain flour for some of the refined white flour.  • If you like bread at dinner, choose a whole-grain muffin over a  Kaiser roll or baguette.  Add beans, nuts, or seeds to salad—they add texture and taste.  • Choose whole-grain pastas and brown rice, cook al dente, and  add some beans and vegetables in equal portions.  • Change it up a bit and experience the taste and satisfaction of  other whole grains such as barley, quinoa, and bulgur.  • Eat snacks high in fiber, such as almonds, pistachios, raisins,  and air-popped popcorn.

This is particularly true for women who breastfeed  their babies, which increases the need in certain nutrients.  Lactation  Preparation for making breast milk, although begun in puberty, is  not completed until a woman’s first pregnancy. Early in the first  trimester, the cells that will secrete milk divide and multiply.  Hormones play a major role in preparing the woman’s body to  breastfeed, particularly during the second and third trimesters. At  that point, levels of the hormone prolactin increase to stimulate the  growth of the milk duct system, which initiates and maintains milk  production. Also during pregnancy, progesterone stimulates growth  of the alveoli, the clusters of cells where the milk is made. During  this process ducts that will carry the milk grow larger and branch  out, and new capillaries are also formed to circulate the increased  blood supply. However, levels of the hormone progesterone need  to decrease for successful milk production, because progesterone  12.\\xa0UNICEF Data. (2019, October).

Although breastfeeding should be recommended and encouraged  for almost all new mothers, it is important to remember that the  decision to breastfeed is a personal choice and women should not  be made to feel guilty if they cannot, or choose not, to breastfeed  their infants. In some rare cases, a woman is unable to breastfeed  or it is not in the baby’s best interest, for example if the baby has  galactosemia, an inborn error of metabolism.  Nutritional choices that parents make, such as the decision to  breastfeed or bottle-feed, not only affect early childhood  development, but also a child’s health and wellness later in life.  Therefore, it is imperative to promote and support the best  practices for the well-being of infants and mothers alike.  812  |  Infancy'},\n",

Although only 1 percent of  the calcium in the human body is found in the blood and soft tissues,  it is here that it performs the most critical functions. Blood calcium  levels are rigorously controlled so that if blood levels drop the body  will rapidly respond by stimulating bone resorption, thereby  releasing stored calcium into the blood. \\xa0Thus, bone tissue sacrifices  its stored calcium to maintain blood calcium levels. This is why bone  health is dependent on the intake of dietary calcium and also why  blood levels of calcium do not always correspond to dietary intake.  Calcium plays a role in a number of different functions in the  body like bone and tooth formation. The most well-known calcium  function is to build and strengthen bones and teeth. Recall that  when bone tissue first forms during the modeling or remodeling  process, it is unhardened, protein-rich osteoid tissue. In the  osteoblast-directed process of bone mineralization, calcium  phosphates (salts) are deposited on the protein matrix. The calcium  salts typically make up about 65 percent of bone tissue. When your  diet is calcium deficient, the mineral content of bone decreases  causing it to become brittle and weak. Thus, increased calcium  intake helps to increase the mineralized content of bone tissue.  Greater mineralized bone tissue corresponds to a greater BMD,  and to greater bone strength. The remaining calcium plays a role  in nerve impulse transmission by facilitating electrical impulse  transmission from one nerve cell to another. Calcium in muscle cells  Calcium  |  613'}]"
